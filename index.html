					<p><span id="big_letter">M</span>y name is Jennie Chu and I am an avid learner. Last year, I started learning the basics of web development. I familiarized myself with basic HTML, CSS, BootStrap, and JQuery, all of which led to to me creating this website.</p>

				</br>

					<p>I have always loved solving and tinkering with puzzles. Hoping to become the next Indiana Jones, I studied Geology and Archaeology.  Eventually, I began working as a College Counselor to give back to my community before teaching myself web design.</p>

				</br>

					<p>This past year, I have been traveling more than before and taking one all encompassing picture of each city I visit.  On my free time away from counseling, designing, and coding, I love playing video games, especially Dota2!</p>

				</br>

					<p>If you have any questions or just want to say hi, you can contact me via twitter or email.</p>
